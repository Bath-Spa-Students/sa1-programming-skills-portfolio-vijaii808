# Lets suppose i want to Print 10 numbers - as per previous practices -
# Through print functions ,  line by line Is it a Good practice ?
# Lets suppose i need to print hundred values ?
# If condition True then Loop Sarts 
# What happens if the condition not false - infinite loop 
# 80 % For Loop Use in loops , also named as counter control loop 

#While Loop 
# 

# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp

# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# Print j as long as j is less than 10:

i = 1
while i < 10:
  print(i)
  i += 1  # i =i+1  


  count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1

    #Infinite Loop With Break Statement 

j = 1
while j < 6:
  print(j)
  if j == 3:
    break
  j += 1   # j=j+1  Both are same 

  #For loop 
  ''''A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.'''
